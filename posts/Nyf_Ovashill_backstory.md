## Description 

My name is Nyf Ovashill and I am 3'3 and 40 lbs. I look like a young 
[Lily Tomlin](#tomlin_footnote) with red hair and I dress in clothing that look
like someone shrunk Aragorn's ranger clothes. I'm 20 years old and a Lightfoot
Halfling. I am neutral good. My weapon of choice is my bow and arrows but I
also have 2 short swords. My armour is leather and I have a raptor steed who
has been my pal since birth, his name is Malky. I'm female but I'm rough around
the edges, not exactly what you'd call cultured, and can be impulsive, bringing
attention on myself and those around me by default. I have a calling to always
help, defend, protect, and heal children, animals, and those in my "troupe". I
am most comfortable in nature.

## History

I had a nomadic tribal upbringing on the Talenta Plains and was raised by my
community. I left at 14 when I met Karm in a travelling band of troop
entertainers as they were performing their way through the plains. At Karm's
performance, he called on me as an audience participant. I happened to trip up
the stairs on the way to the covered wagon stage and got a big laugh from the
crowd. Karm helped me up the stairs saying he wished he had a partner like me
so he could get more laughs. I caught the acting bug and asked if I could be
his assistant so I could learn more about performing. He insisted I work
alongside him instead of assist. From then on we were inseparable, even he and
Malky were friends.


After 5 years of touring and entertaining, Karm and I were doing a bit and
Wilston Karlak was seated front row, center. An attack was perpetrated by enemy
forces using a will-o'-wisp and Karm jumped in the way to to try to protect
Karlak. I, in turn jumped to try to save Karm but it was too late. Our efforts
saved Karlak but Karm died instantly. He was the only partner and best friend I
had and I am still mourning him. I secretly harbour resentment against Karlak
because I wish he had died and not Karm. I'm not happy about this new ugly
thought since dark and angry thoughts are out of character for me. Karlak
summoned me on this mission and I think he assumes I'm in it for the glory of
the quest and possibly the monetary reward, but I have accepted because of my
deep sense of loss. Without Karm I can't imagine having a career or a partner
again and I want to do anything except drift without a distraction from the
pain of losing him. Because of this, my favoured enemy is the will-o'-wisp. 


I discovered my Dragon Mark of the 
[House Jorasco](https://eberron.fandom.com/wiki/House_Jorasco) 
when it started showing after
the stress of losing Karm. This is the mark of healing, It's heraldic beast is
the Griffin. The House's moon is Therandor (Early Spring - March). House
Jorasco provides mundane healing and healthcare to the public and the poor. Now
if I can just figure out how to fully heal after my loss. I feel this adventure
is where I start the process.


My background as an entertainer has taught me skill proficiencies in acrobatics
and performance. I carry a disguise kit with me as well as Karm's wooden flute
that was his great grandfather's. My background was as a comedian (a.k.a.
Jester): I had a long running variety act with Karm that was similar to what
fabled Earthfolk of their year 2019 might call Portlandia but with the artistic
style of Terry Gilliam thrown in magically and mechanically thrown in for
whimsy. We were not above a giant foot "stomping" us in finale. This enables me
to always find a place to perform, at an inn, a tavern, circus, theatre, or
court, and I can receive free lodging and food per each night I perform.
Performance makes me a local figure with strangers recognizing and liking me. 


My personality traits are that I love a good insult, even one directed at me
and that nobody stays angry at me for long since I can diffuse any amount of
tension. My ideals are people and honestly. I love seeing the smiles on
people's faces when I perform and I believe art should reflect the soul: It
should come from within and reveal who we really are. My bond is that I would
do anything for the members of my old troupe (as well as my new). My instrument
is my most treasured possession since it belonged to Karm and Karm's family
before that. My flaws include once satirizing a noble who still wants my
head, it's a mistake I'll likely repeat, and I'm also a sucker for a pretty
face, children, and animals. 


## Words I live by:

* "You enter strong and you exit strong, and you're going to be okay." 

* "I signed on as the clown, and, by golly, I'll keep up my end of the bargain."

* "I always wanted to be somebody, but now I realize I should have been more
specific."

## Footnotes

Not, of course, Earth's 
[Lily Tomlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Tomlin), of whom
Nyf has no knowledge (being, as she is, a resident of Khorvaire), but
the celebrated bard of Thrane, who, through a coincidence of which no-one in 
Eberron is aware, is _also_ named Lily Tomlin, and, through an even more 
astonishing coincidence, bears a striking resemblance to her namesake on
Earth.
